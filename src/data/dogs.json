Malamutes are nimble around furniture and smaller items, making them ideal house dogs, provided they get plenty of time outdoors meeting their considerable exercise requirements. If they are year-round outdoor dogs, letting them play in a baby pool filled with cold water in summer keeps them cool. In the winter, they love snow.

The Border collie is an intelligent dog breed; in fact, it is widely considered to be the most intelligent dog breed. Although the primary role of the Border collie is to herd livestock, this type of breed is becoming increasingly popular as a companion animal.\nIn this role, due to their working heritage, Border collies are very demanding, playful, and energetic. They thrive best in households that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many Border Collies develop problematic behaviors in households that are not able to provide for their needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls, furniture such as chairs and table legs, destructive scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. However, being eminently trainable, they can live amicably with other pets if given proper socialization training.\nBefore taking on the breed as a household pet, potential owners should be sure they can provide regular exercise commensurate with the collie's high energy and prodigious stamina. A working collie may run many miles a day, using its experience, personality and intelligence to control challenging livestock, and these dogs will be distressed and frustrated if left in isolation, ignored or inactive. Like many working breeds, Border collies can be motion-sensitive and may chase moving vehicles and bicycles, but this behavior can be modified by training. Some of the more difficult behaviors require patience, as they are developmental and may disappear as the dog matures.","bestOf":{"active":true},"favClass":"paw fav-off","akcRankHeart":"Pink","ordinal":"th","energyLevelClass":"mdi-run-fast","id":"58f0ea1ecefc5b1678c630c5"},"Boxer":{"_id":"58efdc05272b281a0cbf1f2e","imageURL":"/images/dogs/boxer.jpg","energyLevel":"High","size":"Medium","akcRank":10,"shortDesc":"Fun-loving, bright, active and loyal.

It is in the breed’s nature to be quiet and well behaved, but it is also resistant to training. Chow Chows become very stubborn and attach to certain individuals, as they age. This is why training them when they are puppies is so crucial because they gain respect for those who care for them.\nIn order to avoid aggressive and over-protectiveness as an adult, continuous socialization as early as possible could allow the dog to adjust. When Chow Chows have reached adolescence they reject authority from any other owner who failed to earn its admiration. Aggression can be one distinctive behavioral characteristic in this breed, though while some are of an aggressive nature, many are known to be easy-going in nature - sometimes adopting an aloof disposition to individuals other than their owners. Aggression when it does appear is often towards other dogs of the same sex, especially Chows. Due to their strong hunting instincts, it is recommended that these dogs stay fenced, leashed, and away from cats and small dogs. This is why it is crucial that they are socialized early and consistently in order to act appropriately with strangers. At first, chow chows are very hesitant in interacting with strangers.

These dogs are athletic and can escape from four- to six-foot enclosures with little difficulty. Regular hunting, running, carting, bikejoring, skijoring, mushing, dog scootering or other vigorous activity can alleviate this desire to escape. The natural instinct to hunt may result in the dog hunting alone and sometimes bringing home occasional dead trophies, such as cats, rats, pigeons and other urban animals. In addition to exercise, especially formal hunting, the GSP needs to be taught to distinguish legitimate prey and off limits animals.\nThe GSP can perform virtually all gun dog roles. It is a pointer and retriever, an upland bird dog and water dog. The GSP can be used for hunting larger and more dangerous game. It is an excellent swimmer but also works well in rough terrain.

Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs.

They are intensely loyal and patient pets who appreciate attention but may also be somewhat aloof or independent, as well as thoroughly cunning, particularly with strangers. The Kuvasz breed is for experienced handlers only. The combination of intelligence, independence and protectiveness make obedience training and socialization absolute necessities. They are strictly working dogs, bred for centuries to think independently and act without instruction, scanning and evaluating the environment and taking protective or deterrent action as needed. This was a vital trait in their solitary duties protecting livestock. That independence can make training a difficult task, wearing on the patience of even experienced owners. Kuvasz quickly understand what is being asked of them, but they have to respect a person as a trusted leader before they'll obey commands. They're also not usually interested in meaningless activity, such as doing entertaining tricks. As a result, they are not recommended for novices and those who do not have time to train and socialize them properly. An adolescent Kuvasz should be able to learn basic obedience commands and consistently respond to them; however the instinctive need to investigate strangers and protect its owner may cause the Kuvasz to act independently when off leash and ignore the calls of a handler. Interactions with other dogs, especially first meetings, should be managed carefully. One of the tasks of a livestock guardian is to kill wolves, coyotes, and other predators, and this instinct remains intact in the modern dog. Handlers should be alert to signs of tension, and intervene before a dangerous situation develops. However, a well socialized, well trained Kuvasz will usually ignore, play with, or go exploring with other dogs once a successful introduction has been made. Finally, a potential owner should refrain from purchasing a Kuvasz if barking will be a problem at the home. While not every Kuvasz is prone to barking (socializing them will define what is a threat), many of them fulfill their guardian role by vocally warning off potential threats, both real and imagined. On the other hand, many of these qualities make the Kuvasz excellent guardians for sheep or large estates. The Kuvasz has a very special, close connection to his owner or family, as well as anyone in their circle, human or animal, that the dog considers part of the flock. He will protect all of them. He may also police interactions among them, such as discouraging rough play by herding rowdy individuals away from the group. The owner has the responsibility for setting clear, consistent limits on this behavior. That connection can easily be lost if the dog is humiliated, confused by contradictory commands, or otherwise abused.","bestOf":{"guard":true},"favClass":"paw fav-off","akcRankHeart":"Green","ordinal":"th","energyLevelClass":"mdi-run","id":"58f1062ccefc5b1678c630cb"},"Labrador Retriever":{"_id":"58e6b040f0077232b8e9f38a","breed":"Labrador Retriever","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Labrador_Retriever_black_portrait_Ellis.jpg/512px-Labrador_Retriever_black_portrait_Ellis.jpg","imageRef":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ALabrador_Retriever_black_portrait_Ellis.jpg","imageTitle":"By Marilyn Peddle (Flickr) [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons","imageURL2":"/images/dogs/lab2.jpg","energyLevel":"High","size":"Medium","akcRank":1,"shortDesc":"Active, friendly, enthusiastic and outgoing.

A Lab's sense of smell allows them to home in on almost any scent and follow the path of its origin. They generally stay on the scent until they find it. Labs instinctively enjoy holding objects, which they can do with great gentleness. They are known to have a very soft feel to the mouth, as a result of being bred to retrieve game such as waterfowl. They are prone to chewing objects (though they can be trained to abandon this behavior). Labradors have a reputation as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent family dog. This includes a good reputation with children of all ages and other animals. Their fun-loving boisterousness and lack of fear may require training and firm handling at times to ensure it does not get out of hand. Labs mature at around 3 years of age; before this time they can have a significant degree of puppy-like energy. Because of their enthusiasm, leash-training early on is suggested to prevent pulling when full-grown. Labradors often enjoy retrieving a ball endlessly (often obsessively) and other forms of activity.\nAlthough they will sometimes bark at noise, Labs are usually not noisy or territorial. They are often very easygoing and trusting with strangers and therefore are not usually suitable as guard dogs.\nLabs as a breed are exploratory and love company, following both people and interesting scents for food, attention, and novelty value. As a breed they are highly intelligent and capable of intense single-mindedness and focus if motivated or their interest is caught. Therefore, with the right conditions and stimuli, a bored Labrador could \"turn into an escape artist. Labs have a well-known appetite, and some individuals may be highly indiscriminate, eating digestible and non-food objects alike. They are persistent and persuasive in requesting food. For this reason, the Labrador owner must carefully control their dog's food intake to avoid obesity.\nThe steady temperament and their ability to learn make them an ideal breed for search and rescue, detection, and therapy work.

Old English Sheepdogs should not be deprived of the company and the warmth of people.","bestOf":{"family":true},"favClass":"paw fav-off","akcRankHeart":"Yellow","ordinal":"th","energyLevelClass":"mdi-run","id":"58efe14c272b281a0cbf1f30"},"Pembroke Welsh Corgi":{"_id":"58f0db6e7decb434c07599c2","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Pembroke_Corgi_Image_001.jpg/512px-Pembroke_Corgi_Image_001.jpg","energyLevel":"Medium","size":"Medium","akcRank":18,"shortDesc":"Smart and alert, affectionate but not pushy, bold but kindly.","breedStandard":"http://www.akc.org/embeds/breed-standard/pembroke-welsh-corgi","grooming":"The breed's short coat needs little maintenance.","exercise":"Very Active; A strong and athletic little dog, the Pembroke loves physical activity and is happiest when he has a job.","health":"Pembroke Welsh Corgis are generally a healthy breed, although they can be prone to obesity.

It is important to socialize this breed with other animals, adults, and children when they are very young to avoid any anti-social behavior or aggression later in life.

Once introduced, they are generally friendly to strangers, and enjoy being petted.\nBecause they are working dogs, PWDs are generally content in being at their master's side, awaiting directions, and, if they are trained, they are willing and able to follow complex commands. They learn very quickly, seem to enjoy the training, and have a long memory for the names of objects. These traits and their non-shedding coats mean they excel at the various Service Dog roles such as hearing dogs (assistance dogs for the deaf), mobility dogs, and seizure response dogs. They also make unusually good therapy dogs.\nA PWD usually stays in proximity to its owners, both indoors and outdoors. Although very gregarious animals, these dogs will typically bond with one primary or alpha family member. Some speculate that this intense bonding arose in the breed because the dogs were selected to work in proximity to their masters on small fishing boats, unlike other working dogs such as herding dogs and water dogs that range out to perform tasks. In any case, the modern PWD, whether employed on a boat or kept as a pet or a working dog, loves water and attention and prefers to be engaged in activity within sight of a human partner. This is not a breed to be left alone for long periods of time, indoors or out.\nAs water dogs, the PWD's retrieving instinct is strong, which also gives some dogs tugging and chewing tendencies.\nA PWD will commonly jump as a greeting. Owners may choose to limit this behavior. Some PWDs may walk, hop, or \"dance\" on their hind legs when greeting or otherwise enthusiastic. Some PWDs will stand upright at kitchen counters and tables, especially if they smell food above them. This habit is known as \"counter surfing\" and is characteristic of the breed. Although it can be a nuisance, many PWD owners evidently enjoy seeing their dogs walking, hopping, standing up, or \"countering\" and do not seriously discourage these activities.","bestOf":{"active":true},"favClass":"paw fav-off","akcRankHeart":"Yellow","ordinal":"st","energyLevelClass":"mdi-run-fast","id":"58efe968272b281a0cbf1f35"},"Rat Terrier":{"_id":"58eff013272b281a0cbf1f3a","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Rat_Terrier_Image_001.jpg/512px-Rat_Terrier_Image_001.jpg","energyLevel":"Medium","size":"Small","akcRank":96,"shortDesc":"Friendly, lovable, inquisitive; fearlessly game for just about anything.","breedStandard":"http://www.akc.org/embeds/breed-standard/rat-terrier","grooming":"The breed sheds seasonally and requires brushing with a soft brush or rubber curry mitt.","exercise":"Rat Terriers are little, but they need a lot of extensive activity to maintain health, happiness and an even temperament.
