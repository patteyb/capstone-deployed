The Great Pyrenees protects its flock by barking, and being nocturnal, tends to bark at night unless trained against such behavior.\nThe Great Pyrenees can be slow to learn new commands, slow to obey, and somewhat stubborn to train. Not because of low intelligence, but more likely because the Pyr was bred to be fiercely independent, living on its own in the Pyrenees Mountains protecting its flock. Despite this relative stubbornness, it is quite unusual for the Great Pyrenees to become aggressive or turn on its master. It is wary of strangers if the person is not allowed in the house, but will settle down if the owner of the dog seems comfortable with the stranger. This dog was originally bred to be a livestock guard dog, and can still be found doing that job on farms and ranches.","bestOf":{"guard":true},"favClass":"paw fav-off","akcRankHeart":"Yellow","ordinal":"th","energyLevelClass":"mdi-run","id":"58f1003ccefc5b1678c630c9"},"German Shepherd":{"_id":"58f0fc9dcefc5b1678c630c8","imageURL":"/images/dogs/germanshepherd2.png","energyLevel":"Medium","size":"Large","akcRank":2,"shortDesc":"Smart, confident, courageous, and steady; a true dog lover's dog.","breedStandard":"https://www.akc.org/embeds/breed-standard/german-shepherd-dog","grooming":"The breed's thick double short coat requires regular weekly grooming with a pin brush and slicker brush.","exercise":"These big guys were born to work; they require regular mental and physical exercise.

These dogs love interaction with humans and are suitable pets for active families who will give them an outlet for their considerable energy; they must be avidly run multiple times a week. Most GSPs make excellent watchdogs. The breed generally gets along well with other dogs, though females appear to be much more dominant during interbreed interaction. A strong hunting instinct is correct for the breed, which is not always good for other small pets such as cats or rabbits.\nIf GSPs are not sufficiently exercised and/or properly trained, they can become can appear hyperactive or have destructive tendencies. Thus the breed is not a suitable pet for an inactive home or for inexperienced dog owners. A bored GSP may feel compelled to exercise himself. These dogs are athletic and can escape from four- to six-foot enclosures with little difficulty. Regular hunting, running, carting, bikejoring, skijoring, mushing, dog scootering or other vigorous activity can alleviate this desire to escape. The natural instinct to hunt may result in the dog hunting alone and sometimes bringing home occasional dead trophies, such as cats, rats, pigeons and other urban animals. In addition to exercise, especially formal hunting, the GSP needs to be taught to distinguish legitimate prey and off limits animals.\nThe GSP can perform virtually all gun dog roles. It is a pointer and retriever, an upland bird dog and water dog. The GSP can be used for hunting larger and more dangerous game. It is an excellent swimmer but also works well in rough terrain. It is tenacious, tireless, hardy, and reliable. GSPs are proficient with many different types of game and sport, including trailing, retrieving, and pointing pheasant, quail, grouse, waterfowl, raccoons, possum, and even deer.\nWith this breed having superb hunting ability and companionable personality, the intelligence and the obedience of the GSP make it one of the more popular large breeds.","bestOf":{"active":true},"favClass":"paw fav-off","akcRankHeart":"Red","ordinal":"th","energyLevelClass":"mdi-run-fast","id":"58efebb9272b281a0cbf1f36"},"Golden Retriever":{"_id":"58efd953272b281a0cbf1f2c","imageURL":"/images/dogs/goldenretriever.jpg","energyLevel":"Medium","size":"Large","akcRank":3,"shortDesc":"Intelligent, friendly, and devoted.

Golden Retrievers are exceptionally trainable—due to their intelligence, athleticism and desire to please their handlers—and excel in obedience trials. They are also very competitive in agility and other performance events. Harsh training methods are unnecessary, as Golden Retrievers often respond very well to positive and upbeat training styles.\nGolden Retrievers are compatible with other dogs, cats, and most livestock.

To accomplish this, the dog will not bark but will expect attention to the quarry continuously. Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs. It is not uncommon for these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they have a tendency to bore easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves.\nTheir high energy and drive make these dogs ideally suited to a number of different dog sports such as flyball or agility.

They are intensely loyal and patient pets who appreciate attention but may also be somewhat aloof or independent, as well as thoroughly cunning, particularly with strangers. The Kuvasz breed is for experienced handlers only. The combination of intelligence, independence and protectiveness make obedience training and socialization absolute necessities. They are strictly working dogs, bred for centuries to think independently and act without instruction, scanning and evaluating the environment and taking protective or deterrent action as needed. This was a vital trait in their solitary duties protecting livestock. That independence can make training a difficult task, wearing on the patience of even experienced owners. Kuvasz quickly understand what is being asked of them, but they have to respect a person as a trusted leader before they'll obey commands. They're also not usually interested in meaningless activity, such as doing entertaining tricks. As a result, they are not recommended for novices and those who do not have time to train and socialize them properly. An adolescent Kuvasz should be able to learn basic obedience commands and consistently respond to them; however the instinctive need to investigate strangers and protect its owner may cause the Kuvasz to act independently when off leash and ignore the calls of a handler. Interactions with other dogs, especially first meetings, should be managed carefully. One of the tasks of a livestock guardian is to kill wolves, coyotes, and other predators, and this instinct remains intact in the modern dog. Handlers should be alert to signs of tension, and intervene before a dangerous situation develops. However, a well socialized, well trained Kuvasz will usually ignore, play with, or go exploring with other dogs once a successful introduction has been made. Finally, a potential owner should refrain from purchasing a Kuvasz if barking will be a problem at the home. While not every Kuvasz is prone to barking (socializing them will define what is a threat), many of them fulfill their guardian role by vocally warning off potential threats, both real and imagined. On the other hand, many of these qualities make the Kuvasz excellent guardians for sheep or large estates. The Kuvasz has a very special, close connection to his owner or family, as well as anyone in their circle, human or animal, that the dog considers part of the flock. He will protect all of them. He may also police interactions among them, such as discouraging rough play by herding rowdy individuals away from the group. The owner has the responsibility for setting clear, consistent limits on this behavior. That connection can easily be lost if the dog is humiliated, confused by contradictory commands, or otherwise abused.","bestOf":{"guard":true},"favClass":"paw fav-off","akcRankHeart":"Green","ordinal":"th","energyLevelClass":"mdi-run","id":"58f1062ccefc5b1678c630cb"},"Labrador Retriever":{"_id":"58e6b040f0077232b8e9f38a","breed":"Labrador Retriever","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Labrador_Retriever_black_portrait_Ellis.jpg/512px-Labrador_Retriever_black_portrait_Ellis.jpg","imageRef":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ALabrador_Retriever_black_portrait_Ellis.jpg","imageTitle":"By Marilyn Peddle (Flickr) [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons","imageURL2":"/images/dogs/lab2.jpg","energyLevel":"High","size":"Medium","akcRank":1,"shortDesc":"Active, friendly, enthusiastic and outgoing.

A Lab's sense of smell allows them to home in on almost any scent and follow the path of its origin. They generally stay on the scent until they find it.

They are prone to chewing objects (though they can be trained to abandon this behavior). Labradors have a reputation as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent family dog. This includes a good reputation with children of all ages and other animals. Their fun-loving boisterousness and lack of fear may require training and firm handling at times to ensure it does not get out of hand. Labs mature at around 3 years of age; before this time they can have a significant degree of puppy-like energy. Because of their enthusiasm, leash-training early on is suggested to prevent pulling when full-grown. Labradors often enjoy retrieving a ball endlessly (often obsessively) and other forms of activity.\nAlthough they will sometimes bark at noise, Labs are usually not noisy or territorial. They are often very easygoing and trusting with strangers and therefore are not usually suitable as guard dogs.\nLabs as a breed are exploratory and love company, following both people and interesting scents for food, attention, and novelty value. As a breed they are highly intelligent and capable of intense single-mindedness and focus if motivated or their interest is caught. Therefore, with the right conditions and stimuli, a bored Labrador could \"turn into an escape artist. Labs have a well-known appetite, and some individuals may be highly indiscriminate, eating digestible and non-food objects alike. They are persistent and persuasive in requesting food. For this reason, the Labrador owner must carefully control their dog's food intake to avoid obesity.\nThe steady temperament and their ability to learn make them an ideal breed for search and rescue, detection, and therapy work.

Once introduced, they are generally friendly to strangers, and enjoy being petted.\nBecause they are working dogs, PWDs are generally content in being at their master's side, awaiting directions, and, if they are trained, they are willing and able to follow complex commands. They learn very quickly, seem to enjoy the training, and have a long memory for the names of objects. These traits and their non-shedding coats mean they excel at the various Service Dog roles such as hearing dogs (assistance dogs for the deaf), mobility dogs, and seizure response dogs. They also make unusually good therapy dogs.\nA PWD usually stays in proximity to its owners, both indoors and outdoors. Although very gregarious animals, these dogs will typically bond with one primary or alpha family member. Some speculate that this intense bonding arose in the breed because the dogs were selected to work in proximity to their masters on small fishing boats, unlike other working dogs such as herding dogs and water dogs that range out to perform tasks. In any case, the modern PWD, whether employed on a boat or kept as a pet or a working dog, loves water and attention and prefers to be engaged in activity within sight of a human partner. This is not a breed to be left alone for long periods of time, indoors or out.\nAs water dogs, the PWD's retrieving instinct is strong, which also gives some dogs tugging and chewing tendencies.\nA PWD will commonly jump as a greeting. Owners may choose to limit this behavior. Some PWDs may walk, hop, or \"dance\" on their hind legs when greeting or otherwise enthusiastic. Some PWDs will stand upright at kitchen counters and tables, especially if they smell food above them. This habit is known as \"counter surfing\" and is characteristic of the breed. Although it can be a nuisance, many PWD owners evidently enjoy seeing their dogs walking, hopping, standing up, or \"countering\" and do not seriously discourage these activities.","bestOf":{"active":true},"favClass":"paw fav-off","akcRankHeart":"Yellow","ordinal":"st","energyLevelClass":"mdi-run-fast","id":"58efe968272b281a0cbf1f35"},"Rat Terrier":{"_id":"58eff013272b281a0cbf1f3a","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Rat_Terrier_Image_001.jpg/512px-Rat_Terrier_Image_001.jpg","energyLevel":"Medium","size":"Small","akcRank":96,"shortDesc":"Friendly, lovable, inquisitive; fearlessly game for just about anything.","breedStandard":"https://www.akc.org/embeds/breed-standard/rat-terrier","grooming":"The breed sheds seasonally and requires brushing with a soft brush or rubber curry mitt.","exercise":"Rat Terriers are little, but they need a lot of extensive activity to maintain health, happiness and an even temperament.

They are known in France as guard dogs, a helpers around the farm (herding sheep or cattle), and/or as ring sport dogs (primarily protection training). This athletic, healthy and long-lived breed has been bred to be intelligent, calm, gentle, and fearless.</p><p>Adults are typically suspicious of strangers and are excellent natural guard dogs. On the other hand, they typically take their cue from their handlers when it comes to greeting strangers, and are neither sharp nor shy. They do best when raised within the family but they can sleep outside, the better to act as guards (their weatherproof coats make them ideal kennel users even in the coldest winters). </p><p>They are eager learners and can be trained to a high level. However, their physical and mental development is slow, relative to other similar breeds (e.g. German and other large shepherds): they are not mentally or physically mature until the age of about three years, so their training should not be rushed. Several five- or ten-minute play-training exercises per day in the early years can achieve better results than long or rigorous training sessions.</p>","exercise":"The Beauceron is not an apartment dog, nor is the breed well-suited for a family who just wants an easy-going companion. They are perfect for a true outdoorsperson who likes to walk, hike, bike and swim.

Their short coat may require a bath every few months, or as needed. They shed lightly throughout the year, which is manageable with weekly brushing. Regular nail trimming, ear cleaning and teeth cleaning promote good health.","health":"Beaucerons are generally a healthy breed an average lifespan between 10 and 12 years.

Because of the whippet in their lineage, they have a tendency to bolt.

They form very strong relationship bonds. They are said to be loyal, intelligent, fun, highly trainable and well suited to family life. They should receive plenty of socializing as puppies and will benefit from regular activity and close interaction with people throughout their lifespan. Their herding heritage gives them a comparatively high energy level, and mental as well as physical exercise is necessary to keep a Belgian happy and healthy. In 2012, the North Wales Police force harnessed a Belgian Shepherd herding behavior, headbutting, in a novel approach to subduing criminals. The dogs are muzzled to prevent bites, and trained to forcefully headbutt targets at the midriff on command, knocking them off balance.</p>\n<p>Belgian Shepherds do well in sports such as obedience training and dog agility. They are used as assistance and search and rescue dogs, as well as police, military and narcotics dogs. They are highly trainable and very in-tune with their trainers, making them formidable competitors in agility and herding competitions. Though easily trained, a first-time dog owner is probably not a good choice for this breed, as they will walk all over someone who doesn't have a firm and consistent hand.</p><p>Four types of Belgian sheepdogs have been identified by various registries as separate breeds or varieties: Groenendael, Laekenois, Tervuren, and Malinois. In Belgium (the country of origin) all four types are considered to be varieties of a single breed, differentiated by hair colour and texture. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes only the Groenendael under the name Belgian Sheepdog, but also recognizes the Tervuren and the Malinois as individual breeds (Belgian Tervuren and Belgian Malinois respectively). The Laekenois can be registered as part of the AKC Foundation Stock Service and should eventually be recognised fully by the AKC. The New Zealand Kennel Club recognizes all four as separate breeds. The Australian National Kennel Council, Canadian Kennel Club, Kennel Union of South Africa, United Kennel Club and the Kennel Club (UK) recognize all four as varieties of the same breed.</p>","health":"Although a generally healthy variety of dog, Belgian Shepherds can be susceptible to hip dysplasia, epilepsy, gastric problems (including bloats and torsions), and some eye and skin problems.

Twice a year they will blow their entire coat, which will require extra grooming time. Regular bathing can be given as needed, but may also help with seasonal shedding.

This breed is famed for its ability to discern human scent over great distances, even days later. Its extraordinarily keen sense of smell is combined with a strong and tenacious tracking instinct, producing the ideal scent hound, and it is used by police and law enforcement all over the world to track escaped prisoners, missing people, lost children and lost pets.</p>\n<p>This breed is gentle, and is tireless when following a scent. Because of its strong tracking instinct, it can be willful and somewhat difficult to obedience train and handle on a leash. Bloodhounds have an affectionate and even-tempered nature with humans, making excellent family pets. However, like any pet, they require supervision when around small children.</p>\n<p>Bred to live in packs, the Bloodhound is active and needs daily exercise to prevent boredom. As sweet-natured as Bloodhounds are, their amazing nose can sometimes lead them into trouble. A strong leash and long walks in places where they can enjoy sniffing around are recommended. Built for stamina, the Bloodhound needs fenced sniffing around space and enjoys an active family.</p>\n<p>Bloodhounds are known for their deep, baying barks.

The breed also suffers an unusually high incidence of eye, skin, and ear ailments; thus these areas should be inspected frequently for signs of developing problems. Owners should be especially aware of the signs of bloat, which is both the most common illness and the leading cause of death of Bloodhounds.

A hound mitt should be used instead of a brush because of their thin skin. The folds of their skin should be wiped down and dried daily to prevent bacterial infections.
