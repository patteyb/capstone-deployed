                  <p>Okay, so you've been thinking about this for a while now.</p> 
                  <p>A furry friend to help you through those episodes of <em>Walking Dead</em> you love to binge. Or maybe you love the outdoors and would love a hiking companion. Or you need a good watchdog and friend for your children.</p>

                  <p>Whatever your reason, congratulations on making the stupendous decision to welcome a dog into your life! Now you need to research what kind of dog would work best for you and your family. Would a couch-potato pooch fit your lifestyle best, or a dog that loves to be on the go? Will you have the time to take your dog for a daily walk, or do you need a dog that can meet his exercise needs running around the house? Noise levels, grooming requirements, friendliness...so many things to consider.</p>

                  <h3>Does Breed Matter?</h3>
                  <p>First things first, you need to figure out what breed of dog makes the best sense for you. Dogs will vary within a breed, but you reduce the chances of getting a squirrel-chasing barker when you really wanted a low-key lapdog if you do some research. And here's where ADogforMe.com can help. Click on <i class="mdi mdi-chevron-double-right"></i> BREEDS and begin the fun journey of finding the perfect dog for you. You can read all about different breeds, watch videos, and find rescue dogs within your area.</p>

                  <p>Check out <a href="https://pethelpful.com/dogs/Choosing-a-Dog-Why-Breed-Matters" target="_blank">this article</a> on why knowing something about dog breeds can help in your search for the best companion for your lifestyle.

                  <p>If you have some idea of what criteria your perfect dog friend would meet, then select click <i class="mdi mdi-chevron-double-right"></i> BREEDS from the menu and select FILTER LIST to find dog breeds that meet various selection criteria.</p>

                  <p>And if you would like to save dog breeds to a favorites list, or save and track rescue dogs, then SIGN UP for your own personal account. You can save your research and return back to it at your leisure.</p>

                  <h3>Buy or Rescue?</h3>
                  <p><img src="/images/tab3-pug.jpg" alt="" hide show-gt-xs>In a perfect world, this wouldn't even be a question to consider. The reality, however, is that there are many, many dogs out there needing a home. Dogs of every spot, size, and temperment just waiting for a new home!</p>

                  <p>What? You want a particular breed, and don't want to risk getting an unhealthy or damaged dog? Purchasing from a breeder is no guarantee of health or perfect temperment. There are many reputable breeders out there, but there are irreputable ones as well. Buyer beware and do your research!</p>

                  <p>And what about that adorable pup in the store window? Well, they need homes also. I would caution you against an impulse buy. Bringing a dog into your life is about long-term commitment and responsibility and shouldn't be an off-the-cuff decision. But if you absolutely fall in love with a bouncy fuzzface, then don't let your friends make you feel guilty about not getting a shelter dog.</p>

                  <p>I've purchased a dog from a store, bought from breeders, and rescued dogs. They've all had their personality quirks and health concerns, no matter where I found my new companion. The trick is to do your research, talk to the breeder, store or shelter staff, and, if you can, spend time visiting your potential new friend.</p>
